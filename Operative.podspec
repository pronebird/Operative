                        Provides a NSOperation sublass with a more advanced state machine.

                        Some features provided:
                          - Easily perform asynchronous 'work' in an operation - even displaying UI such as UIAlertController's
                          - Optionally support 'exclusiviity' guarantees across mulitple instances of the same operation class, even across multiple queues!
                          - Operation delegate - be informed when an operation starts, finishes, or produces sub-operations
