/**
 *  A subclass of `OPOperation` that executes zero or more operations as part
 *  of its own execution. This class of operation is very useful for abstracting
 *  several smaller operations into a larger operation.
 *
 *  Additionally, `OPGroupOperation`s are useful if you establish a chain of
 *  dependencies, but part of the chain may "loop". For example, if you have an
 *  operation that requires the user to be authenticated, you may consider
 *  putting the "login" operation inside a group operation. That way,
 *  the "login" operation may produce subsequent operations
 *  (still within the outer `OPGroupOperation`) that will all be executed before
 *  the rest of the operations in the initial chain of operations.
 *
 *  - returns: An instance of `OPGroupOperation
